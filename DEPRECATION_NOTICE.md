# Darkness Extension Deprecation Notice

## ⚠️ Extension No Longer Functional

Darkness was a browser extension that provided **dark themes** for many popular websites, such as Google, Facebook, Gmail and YouTube.

As of July 2025, the Darkness browser extension is **permanently non-functional** due to Google Chrome's deprecation of Manifest V2 extensions. This affects both:

- ❌ **Self-hosted version** - Cannot be loaded in modern Chrome browsers
- ❌ **Chrome Web Store version** - Cannot be installed or used

## Why This Happened

Google has deprecated Manifest V2 extensions as part of their security and performance improvements:

- **January 2022:** Chrome Web Store stopped accepting new Manifest V2 extensions
- **June 2024:** Warning banners started appearing for Manifest V2 extensions
- **March 2025:** Manifest V2 extensions disabled by default
- **June 2025:** Complete removal of Manifest V2 support in Chrome 139+
